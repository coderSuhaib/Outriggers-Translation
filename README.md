# Outriggers Translation Website

My client requested a website for their industrial translation company. I created four web pages to reflect their vision of their business.
My biggest challenges came with hosting the website. I had to figure out how to work with a windows server and create a  webconfig file 
in order to hide the file extensions in the URLs. I also had to figure out how to interact with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and 
reflect the desired solution in my HTML.

The Client was very satisfied with the results. The Final product can be seen [http://outriggerstranslation.com/](http://outriggerstranslation.com/).
